# Hand Gesture Mouse Control System

A computer-vision–based system that allows controlling mouse actions using hand gestures captured through a webcam.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how hand landmarks can be used to control mouse movement and actions such as clicking, scrolling, dragging, and pausing input.

## Key Capabilities
- Cursor movement using hand position
- Left and right mouse click using finger gestures
- Scroll control using two-finger gestures
- Drag and drop functionality
- Pause and resume control for safety

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Webcam
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe hand landmark model

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2.Run the application:
      python main_v3.py

Credits

This project was inspired by a publicly shared hand-gesture mouse control demonstration.
The original concept was explored using AI-assisted tools.
This repository reflects my own work in understanding, debugging, modifying, and extending the system.
